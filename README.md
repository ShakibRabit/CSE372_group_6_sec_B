An Arduino-based radar system employs an Arduino microcontroller and radar sensor modules to detect objects' presence, distance, and speed within its range. This system typically utilizes ultrasonic or microwave radar technology to emit signals and analyze their reflections for object detection. The Arduino processes the incoming data, interprets it, and triggers appropriate responses, such as displaying information on an LCD screen, sounding alarms, or controlling actuators. These radar systems are often versatile, customizable, and serve various applications, including proximity detection, object tracking, and obstacle avoidance in robotics, security, and automotive industries.
